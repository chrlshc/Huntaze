# Deployment Diagnostic Report

**Generated:** 2025-11-03T16:07:28.790Z
**Status:** IDENTIFIED

## Issue Summary

**Title:** Amplify Auto-Deployment Not Triggering
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Deployment pipeline broken

Commits to staging branch are not automatically triggering AWS Amplify deployments

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause:** Staging branch has no upstream tracking

### Details:
- The local staging branch is not configured to track a remote branch\n- Git pushes are not reaching the repository monitored by Amplify\n- Amplify webhooks are not being triggered because no commits reach the remote

### Evidence:
```json
{
  "currentBranch": "staging",
  "stagingTracking": "None",
  "remotesAvailable": 0.5
}
```

## Solution

**Type:** Git Configuration Fix
**Estimated Time:** 2-5 minutes

### Steps:
1. **Set upstream tracking for staging branch**
   - Command: `git branch --set-upstream-to=huntaze/staging staging`
   - Description: Configure staging branch to track huntaze/staging remote\n\n2. **Test push connectivity**
   - Command: `git push huntaze staging`
   - Description: Verify that pushes reach the correct remote repository\n\n3. **Monitor Amplify console**
   - Command: `Check AWS Amplify console for build trigger`
   - Description: Verify that Amplify receives webhook and starts build

### Automated Fix
Run the automated fix script:
```bash
node scripts/fix-git-remotes.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Execute the solution steps above
2. Test deployment by pushing to staging branch
3. Monitor Amplify console for automatic build trigger
4. If issues persist, escalate to AWS Amplify support
