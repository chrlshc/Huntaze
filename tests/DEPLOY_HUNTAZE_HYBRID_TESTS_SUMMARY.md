- AWS SDK calls are mocked, not real
- File system operations are mocked
- Git operations are mocked

### Coverage Gaps
- Actual bash script execution not tested
- Real AWS resource creation not tested
- Actual git operations not tested
- Real file system operations not tested

### Recommendations
- Run manual integration tests in staging environment
- Verify actual AWS resource creation
- Test with real AWS credentials (in safe environment)
- Validate actual deployment to Amplify
