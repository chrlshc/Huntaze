## Key Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User uploads file → Validates → Stores in S3 → Processes → Serves via CDN
2. User creates collection → Adds assets → Tags assets → Searches successfully
3. User shares asset → Sets permissions → Tracks access → Revokes access

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid file format → Validation error
2. File too large → Size limit error
3. S3 unavailable → Retry with exponential backoff
4. Processing timeout → Graceful failure
5. CDN cache miss → Fetch from origin

### Edge Cases
- Special characters in filenames
- Very long filenames (>255 chars)
- Concurrent uploads (100+ simultaneous)
- Corrupted media files
- Storage quota exceeded
- Expired signed URLs
- Processing timeouts

## Mocking Strategy

### AWS SDK Mocks
- S3 client operations (upload, download, delete)
- CloudFront operations (invalidation, signed URLs)
- Lambda processing (image resize, video transcode)

### External Dependencies
- File system operations
- Network requests
- Database operations (Prisma)

## Code Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests:** ≥ 90% coverage
- **Integration Tests:** ≥ 80% coverage
- **Overall:** ≥ 85% coverage

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Every commit to feature branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Pre-deployment validation
- Scheduled nightly builds

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Identify the requirement being tested
2. Choose appropriate test type (unit/integration/e2e)
3. Follow existing naming conventions
4. Update this README with new test information

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Ensure backward compatibility
2. Update regression tests if behavior changes
3. Maintain 100% requirement coverage
4. Document breaking changes

## Known Limitations

1. **AWS SDK Mocking:** Tests use mocks, not real AWS services
2. **Media Processing:** Actual processing tested in Lambda tests
3. **Network Latency:** Not simulated in unit tests
4. **Concurrent Load:** Limited to test environment capacity
