## Key Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User creates campaign → Validates → Saves to database
2. User schedules campaign → Launches at scheduled time → Tracks metrics
3. User creates A/B test → Runs test → Determines winner → Applies winner
4. User creates automation → Trigger fires → Actions execute → Results verified
5. User creates segment → Calculates size → Launches targeted campaign

### Error Scenarios
1. Invalid campaign data → Returns validation errors
2. Platform API failures → Retries with exponential backoff
3. Budget exceeded → Pauses campaign automatically
4. Automation trigger failure → Logs error and skips
5. Segment calculation error → Returns error message

### Edge Cases
- Empty campaign content
- Very large campaigns (1000+ recipients)
- Concurrent campaign launches
- A/B test with insufficient sample size
- Automation with circular dependencies
- Segment with complex criteria (10+ conditions)
- Multi-platform publishing with partial failures
- Budget alerts at exact thresholds
- Timezone edge cases (DST transitions)

## Mocking Strategy

### External Services
- **ContentGenerationService:** Mocked AI responses
- **PublishingService:** Mocked platform API calls
- **CloudWatchMetricsService:** Mocked metrics sending
- **EventEmitter:** Mocked event handling

### Database
- **Prisma:** Mocked database operations
- **Transactions:** Mocked transaction handling

### Time
- **Date.now():** Mocked for consistent timestamps
- **setTimeout:** Mocked for automation delays

## Code Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests:** ≥ 90% coverage
- **Integration Tests:** ≥ 80% coverage
- **Overall:** ≥ 85% coverage

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Every commit to feature branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Pre-deployment validation
- Scheduled nightly builds

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Identify the requirement being tested
2. Choose appropriate test type (unit/integration/e2e)
3. Follow existing naming conventions
4. Update this README with new test information

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Ensure backward compatibility
2. Update regression tests if behavior changes
3. Maintain 100% requirement coverage
4. Document breaking changes

## Known Limitations

1. **External API Mocking:** Tests use mocks, not real platform APIs
2. **Time-based Tests:** Some tests may be flaky due to timing
3. **Database:** Tests use mocked Prisma, not real database
4. **Concurrency:** Limited concurrent test execution
