2. **Deployment Strategy**: Tests canary deployment, feature flags, and rollback procedures
3. **Production Readiness**: Validates end-to-end workflows, load testing, and security
4. **Documentation**: Ensures operational runbooks and user guides are complete

**Overall Progress**: 
- ✅ Test infrastructure: 100% complete
- ✅ Phase 2-4 implementation: 75% complete
- ⏳ Phase 1, 5-8 implementation: Pending
- ⏳ Test execution: Blocked by configuration issue

**Recommendation**: Fix the Vitest configuration issue and execute all tests to validate the implementation progress.
