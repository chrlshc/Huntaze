🔧 STAGING FIX: Resolve Node.js download timeout in Amplify deployment

- Remove nvm Node.js installation to avoid download timeouts
- Use default Amplify Node.js version for faster builds
- Add network resilience with extended timeouts (300s)
- Implement fallback npm install strategy
- Add pre-build diagnostics script
- Optimize memory settings and disable telemetry
- Add build timeout protection with retry logic

Fixes deployment failure at 28% Node.js download phase.
Ready for immediate staging deployment.
