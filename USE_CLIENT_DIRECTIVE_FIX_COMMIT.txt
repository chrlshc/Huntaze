fix: Move 'use client' directive to first line in analytics page

Critical fix for Next.js build failure:
- Moved 'use client' directive to be the absolute first line
- Removed JSDoc comment that was interfering with directive placement
- Next.js requires 'use client' to be before all other expressions
- This resolves webpack build error preventing deployment

Files changed:
- app/analytics/advanced/page.tsx: Fixed directive placement

Build error resolved:
- Error: Expected '>', got 'fallback' 
- Root cause: 'use client' directive not at top of file
- Solution: Moved directive to line 1, before all comments and imports

This fix ensures proper client-side rendering for the analytics page
and resolves the staging deployment build failure.
