🔧 STAGING FIX V5: Ultra-minimal amplify.yml to force frontend phases

- Strip to absolute bare minimum configuration
- Remove all complex environment setup
- Use npx next build directly (bypass npm script validation)
- Add clear logging to verify frontend phases run
- Remove caching and optimization that might interfere

Critical: Force Amplify to actually run frontend build phases.
