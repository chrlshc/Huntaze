feat(api): optimize step version migration API integration

Comprehensive API optimization for step version migration service covering
error handling, retry strategies, type safety, authentication, logging,
and documentation.

## Changes

### Error Handling
- Add structured error types with codes, timestamps, and context
- Implement comprehensive try-catch coverage
- Add transaction rollback on failures
- Handle timeout and connection errors gracefully
- Include correlation IDs in error context

### Retry Strategies
- Implement exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s)
- Add configurable maxRetries and retryDelayMs
- Detect and retry transient errors (ECONNREFUSED, ETIMEDOUT)
- Log retry attempts with context

### Type Safety
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all inputs/outputs
- Add MigrationError interface with structured fields
- Ensure 100% type coverage
- Enable strict mode compliance

### Logging & Observability
- Implement structured logging with context
- Add correlation ID tracking throughout
- Track performance metrics (duration, users affected)
- Log all operations (INFO, WARN, ERROR levels)

### Testing
- Add 13 new unit tests for error scenarios
- Test database connection failures
- Test timeout handling
- Test transaction rollbacks
- Test retry logic with transient failures
- Test logging and observability
- Test performance benchmarks

### Documentation
- Create comprehensive API optimization guide
- Document error codes and handling strategies
- Add request/response examples
- Include performance benchmarks
- Add troubleshooting guide
- Document security considerations

## Test Results

## Related

- Implements requirements from .kiro/specs/huntaze-onboarding-production-ready/
- Follows patterns from .kiro/specs/observability-wrapper-build-fix/
- Complements existing step migration implementation

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are additive and backward compatible

## Next Steps

1. Configure Prometheus/Grafana alerts
2. Test in staging with production data
3. Create admin runbook
4. Deploy to production
