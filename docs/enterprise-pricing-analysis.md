# Enterprise Pricing – 0% Platform Fee (Annual Commitment)

## Summary
- **0% platform fee**, billed **annually** at **$4,788/year ($399/mo equivalent)**.
- Rationale: eliminate “platform tax” perception for top creators & agencies; align with premium SaaS norms.
- Applies to: high‑volume creators, agencies, multi‑account teams needing SSO, custom AI training, SLAs.

## Why 0% (Market & Ops)
- Market benchmark: premium SaaS tiers avoid take‑rates; percentage fees are a barrier at scale.
- Our caps already de‑risk growth in Scale; 0% Enterprise is the natural top step.
- Ops: annual commitment offsets onboarding + support costs; allows capacity planning.

## Unit Economics (High Level)
- Base fee covers infra + support baseline.
- Message costs managed via **policy routing** (premium for revenue‑critical, economy for routine) to maintain ≥70–80% gross margin.
- Optional overage (contractual) if message volume materially exceeds baseline.

## Positioning & Message
- **“Keep 100% of your sales with Huntaze (payment processing not included).”**
- “Annual only” clearly labeled on pricing card and checkout.
- Compare vs agency 50% and vs capped Scale to show total cost delta above ~$10.7k GMV.

## Migration Notes
- Existing Enterprise customers: no action required; they are moved to 0% at renewal with a credit note if applicable.
- Contracts: add annual commitment clause and SLA appendix.
