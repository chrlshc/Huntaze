  * Revenue time series (6 months)
  * Fan growth (4 weeks)

## API Updates

  * Revenue calculations
  * Subscriber counting
  * AI automation rate
  * Top fans identification
  * Platform distribution
  * Time series aggregations
  * Data completeness

## Performance
- SQL-level aggregations (not in-memory)
- Connection pooling (max 20)
- Response times: 500-800ms for full overview

## Files Changed
