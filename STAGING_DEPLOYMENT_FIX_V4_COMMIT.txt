🔧 STAGING FIX V4: Minimal defensive amplify.yml for artifact production

- Strip down to minimal, proven configuration
- Remove complex diagnostic scripts that may interfere
- Focus on core: install deps → build → produce artifacts
- Add artifact validation with ls and test commands
- Ensure .next directory is created and validated
- Remove potential build blockers and timeouts

Critical fix: Ensure artifacts are produced so Deploy phase runs.
