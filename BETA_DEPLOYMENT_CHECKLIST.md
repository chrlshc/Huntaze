## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Steps (Execute NOW)

### Step 1: Cleanup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Execute cleanup script
bash scripts/cleanup-for-production.sh

# Verify file count
git ls-files | wc -l
# Expected: < 1000 files (currently 130,495!)
```

**What it does:**
- Removes 181 .md files from root (test summaries, status files)
- Cleans test documentation
- Updates .gitignore to prevent future pollution
- Reduces from 130k → ~500 files

### Step 2: Fix Dependencies (10 minutes)
```bash
# Fix ESLint and nodemailer conflicts
bash scripts/fix-dependencies.sh
```

**What it fixes:**
- ✅ ESLint peer dependency conflict (Job 62)
- ✅ Turbopack nodemailer issue (Job 63)
- ✅ Clean build artifacts

### Step 3: Commit & Push (2 minutes)
```bash
# Review changes
git status

# Commit cleanup
git commit -m "chore: cleanup for production beta - remove test artifacts"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```
