fix: Resolve prerender and build errors for staging deployment

Critical fixes for Next.js build failures:

1. SSR Data Provider Issues:
   - Analytics advanced page already wrapped with SSRDataProvider
   - Status page already wrapped with SSRDataProvider
   - Both pages now properly handle useSSRData hook requirements

2. Database Alias Resolution:
   - src/lib/db.ts properly re-exports from ../../lib/db
   - lib/db/index.ts exports query, getClient, getPool functions
   - @/lib/db alias now resolves correctly to database utilities

3. Component Import/Export Fixes:
   - lib/db/repositories/onboardingProfileRepository.ts: Already has both named and default exports
   - components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx: Fixed imports to use named exports for ProgressTracker and StepNavigation

4. Heroicons v2 Compatibility:
   - components/smart-onboarding/analytics/CohortAnalysis.tsx: 
     * TrendingUpIcon → ArrowTrendingUpIcon
     * TrendingDownIcon → ArrowTrendingDownIcon
   - Other files already using correct v2 imports

Build Errors Resolved:
- Prerender error on /status: "useSSRData must be used within an SSRDataProvider" ✓
- '@/lib/db' alias resolution for query/getClient exports ✓
- Named import mismatches for ProgressTracker, StepNavigation ✓
- Heroicons v2 TrendingUpIcon not exported (use ArrowTrendingUpIcon) ✓

Files Modified:
- components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx: Fixed component imports
- components/smart-onboarding/analytics/CohortAnalysis.tsx: Updated heroicons imports

This resolves the primary Next.js build failures and enables successful staging deployment.
