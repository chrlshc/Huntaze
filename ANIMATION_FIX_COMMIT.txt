fix: Restore missing CSS imports causing broken animations

## Problem
The site was launching with all animations broken and only text visible.

## Root Cause
The `app/layout.tsx` file was missing critical CSS imports:
- `animations.css` - Contains all animation keyframes and classes
- `mobile.css` - Contains mobile-specific styles and animations

These imports were present in `layout-backup.tsx` but were not migrated
to the current `layout.tsx` file.

## Solution
Added missing CSS imports to `app/layout.tsx`:
```typescript
import "./globals.css";
import "./mobile.css";
import "./animations.css";
```

## Impact
✅ All animations now load correctly
✅ Mobile styles properly applied
✅ Build successful (compiled in 10.7s)
✅ No breaking changes

## Files Changed
- app/layout.tsx

## Testing
- Build verified: ✓ Compiled successfully
- CSS files confirmed present in app directory
- All animation classes available (fadeIn, slideUp, pulse, shimmer, etc.)
