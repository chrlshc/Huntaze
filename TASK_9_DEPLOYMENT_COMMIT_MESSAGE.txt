## 📊 Monitoring Metrics

### Primary Metrics Tracked
| Metric | Alert Threshold | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Hydration Errors** | > 5/min | React #130 errors detected |
| **Response Time** | > 3000ms | Critical pages latency |
| **Error Rate** | > 5% | Failed requests percentage |
| **UX Score** | < 70/100 | User experience evaluation |

### Critical Pages Monitored
- ✅ Homepage (`/`)
- ✅ Login (`/auth/login`)
- ✅ Registration (`/auth/register`)
- ✅ Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- ✅ Onboarding (`/onboarding/setup`)

## 🚨 Alert System

### Alert Severity Levels
#### 🔴 High Severity
- **Hydration errors**: > 5 errors/minute
- **High error rate**: > 5% failed requests
- **Application unavailable**

#### 🟡 Medium Severity
- **High response time**: > 3 seconds
- **Low UX score**: < 70/100
- **Performance degradation**

### Automated Actions
- **Real-time metrics collection**
- **Alert generation and logging**
- **Comprehensive reporting**
- **Historical data preservation**

## 📁 Logging & Reporting

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Complete Deployment Workflow
```bash
# 1. Validate prerequisites
node scripts/validate-deployment-prerequisites.js

# 2. Full deployment (staging + production validation)
node scripts/deploy-hydration-complete.js

# 3. Start continuous monitoring
node scripts/monitor-hydration-production.js start
```

### Individual Operations
```bash
# Staging deployment only
node scripts/deploy-hydration-staging.js

# Production validation only
node scripts/validate-hydration-production.js

# Generate monitoring report
node scripts/monitor-hydration-production.js summary
```
