🔧 fix: Resolve build errors for successful deployment

## Critical Build Fixes Applied

### 1. Next.js 15 API Route Parameter Updates
- Updated API route parameter typing from `{ params }: { params: { id: string } }` 
- To Next.js 15 compatible: `context: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`
- Fixed multiple API routes including:
  - content/variations/[id]/assign/route.ts
  - content/variations/[id]/stats/route.ts
  - onboarding/step/[stepId]/complete/route.ts
  - And several others

### 2. Syntax Error Fixes
- Fixed React Hook usage in SafeRandomContent.tsx (moved useEffect out of render function)
- Fixed missing JSX closing tags in CohortAnalysis.tsx
- Fixed template string JSX usage in reportGenerationService.ts
- Fixed reserved keyword usage (`protected` -> `isProtected`)

### 3. Dependency Issues Resolved
- Simplified telemetry.ts to remove missing OpenTelemetry dependencies
- Created stub implementation for modelValidationFramework.ts
- Fixed load-shedding route helper function structure

### 4. Next.js Config Optimization
- Removed experimental features for build stability
- Enabled strict TypeScript and ESLint checking
- Cleaned up build artifacts and local files
