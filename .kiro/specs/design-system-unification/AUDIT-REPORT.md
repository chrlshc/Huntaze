## Token Coverage Analysis

### Existing Design Tokens

✅ Comprehensive token system exists in `styles/design-tokens.css`:
- Background colors (primary, secondary, tertiary, glass)
- Border colors (subtle, default, emphasis, strong)
- Text colors (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary)
- Accent colors (primary, success, warning, error, info)
- Shadows (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, inner-glow, accent)
- Spacing system (0-32, 4px grid)
- Typography (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
- Border radius (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl, full)
- Transitions (fast, base, slow, slower)
- Z-index scale (dropdown, sticky, modal, tooltip)
- Component tokens (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Layout tokens (max-widths, sidebar, header)
- Backdrop blur (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl)

### Migration Recommendations

1. **Start with high-priority files** - These have the most hardcoded values
2. **Focus on colors first** - Most visible impact on consistency
3. **Update component library** - Ensures new usage is correct
4. **Create utility classes** - For common patterns (glass-card, etc.)
5. **Document patterns** - Help developers use tokens correctly
