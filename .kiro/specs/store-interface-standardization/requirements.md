# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical inconsistencies in store interfaces and hook function naming that are causing test failures in Huntaze. The system currently has 821 passing tests but suffers from interface mismatches between hooks and their expected APIs, preventing full functionality.

## Glossary

- **Hook_Interface**: The public API exposed by React hooks for state management operations
- **Store_Operations**: Functions that manipulate application state (create, read, update, delete)
- **Optimistic_Updates**: UI updates applied immediately before server confirmation
- **Content_Creation_System**: The system managing media assets, campaigns, and scheduling
- **Function_Naming_Convention**: Standardized naming pattern for hook methods

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the content creation hooks, I want consistent function names across all hooks, so that I can use them predictably without checking implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls optimistic update functions, THE Hook_Interface SHALL provide consistent naming patterns across all entity types
2. WHEN accessing asset operations, THE Hook_Interface SHALL expose functions with the pattern `optimistic[Action][Entity]` (e.g., `optimisticUpdateAsset`, `optimisticCreateAsset`)
3. WHEN accessing campaign operations, THE Hook_Interface SHALL expose functions with the pattern `optimistic[Action][Entity]` (e.g., `optimisticUpdateCampaign`, `optimisticCreateCampaign`)
4. WHERE backward compatibility is required, THE Hook_Interface SHALL provide aliases for existing function names
5. THE Hook_Interface SHALL maintain consistent parameter signatures across similar operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the content creation store, I want all store operations to be properly connected to the hooks, so that optimistic updates reflect in the UI immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing optimistic updates, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL immediately update the store state
2. WHEN an optimistic operation fails, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL revert the store to its previous state
3. WHEN multiple operations are pending, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL maintain operation order and dependencies
4. THE Store_Operations SHALL integrate with the conflict resolution system for concurrent updates
5. THE Store_Operations SHALL provide real-time synchronization with server state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the test suite, I want all hook interfaces to match their test expectations, so that tests pass consistently and validate actual functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call hook functions, THE Hook_Interface SHALL provide all expected methods without undefined errors
2. WHEN tests perform batch operations, THE Hook_Interface SHALL support batch update functionality
3. WHEN tests check operation status, THE Hook_Interface SHALL provide pending, success, and failure states
4. THE Hook_Interface SHALL support rollback operations for failed optimistic updates
5. THE Hook_Interface SHALL provide utilities for clearing completed operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer managing application state, I want proper store integration for all content creation entities, so that the UI stays synchronized with backend data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new assets, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL update the media assets store immediately
2. WHEN updating campaigns, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL reflect changes in the campaigns store
3. WHEN scheduling content, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL update the schedule store with new items
4. THE Content_Creation_System SHALL handle pagination state updates during CRUD operations
5. THE Content_Creation_System SHALL maintain loading and error states for all store sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing real-time features, I want hooks to integrate properly with the existing store architecture, so that SSE updates and optimistic mutations work together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSE events are received, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL update optimistic data appropriately
2. WHEN conflicts are detected, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL integrate with the conflict resolution hook
3. WHEN sync status changes, THE Content_Creation_System SHALL update the store sync state
4. THE Content_Creation_System SHALL coordinate between optimistic updates and real-time events
5. THE Content_Creation_System SHALL prevent race conditions between local and remote updates
