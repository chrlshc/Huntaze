# Requirements Document - Huntaze Hybrid Orchestrator Integration

## Introduction

Integration of the validated Hybrid Orchestrator system into the existing Huntaze OnlyFans management application. This feature enables intelligent AI provider routing (Azure/OpenAI), advanced rate limiting, and cost optimization while maintaining backward compatibility with existing workflows.

## Glossary

- **Hybrid_Orchestrator**: The intelligent AI routing system that coordinates between Azure OpenAI and OpenAI providers
- **Rate_Limiter**: Multi-layer rate limiting system preventing API abuse and OnlyFans platform violations
- **Content_Pipeline**: Existing Huntaze content generation and distribution workflow
- **OnlyFans_Gateway**: Existing service for OnlyFans API interactions
- **Legacy_Endpoints**: Current API endpoints that must remain functional during migration
- **Production_Environment**: Live Huntaze application serving real users
- **Fallback_System**: Automatic provider switching when primary AI service fails

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Huntaze user, I want my content generation requests to be processed through the most cost-effective AI provider, so that I can reduce operational costs while maintaining quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a content generation request is received, THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL route the request to the optimal AI provider based on request type
2. WHEN Azure OpenAI is selected for content planning, THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL process multi-platform campaigns through Azure
3. WHEN OpenAI is selected for message generation, THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL process personalized messages through OpenAI
4. IF the primary provider fails, THEN THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL automatically fallback to the secondary provider
5. THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL log provider selection decisions and performance metrics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Huntaze user, I want automatic rate limiting protection, so that my OnlyFans account remains compliant and avoids platform restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rate_Limiter SHALL enforce a maximum of 10 requests per minute per user for OnlyFans messaging
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded, THE Rate_Limiter SHALL block additional requests and return retry timing
3. THE Rate_Limiter SHALL track rate limit violations across multiple time windows (minute, hour, day)
4. WHILE rate limiting is active, THE Rate_Limiter SHALL provide real-time status information to users
5. THE Rate_Limiter SHALL integrate with existing OnlyFans_Gateway without breaking current functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Huntaze administrator, I want seamless integration with existing workflows, so that current users experience no disruption during the upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Production_Environment SHALL maintain all existing API endpoints during integration
2. WHEN Legacy_Endpoints receive requests, THE Production_Environment SHALL process them through the new Hybrid_Orchestrator
3. THE Production_Environment SHALL preserve existing authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. THE Production_Environment SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing client applications
5. WHERE configuration changes are required, THE Production_Environment SHALL use environment variables with sensible defaults

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Huntaze user, I want real-time monitoring of AI costs and usage, so that I can optimize my spending and track performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL track token usage and costs for both Azure and OpenAI providers
2. THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL provide real-time cost metrics through a monitoring dashboard
3. WHEN cost thresholds are exceeded, THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL send alerts to administrators
4. THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL generate daily cost reports with provider breakdown
5. THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL expose metrics through existing monitoring infrastructure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Huntaze developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL log all provider routing decisions with timestamps and reasoning
2. WHEN errors occur, THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL capture detailed error context and stack traces
3. THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL integrate with existing logging infrastructure (CloudWatch)
4. THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring systems
5. IF critical errors occur, THEN THE Hybrid_Orchestrator SHALL trigger automated alerts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Huntaze user, I want gradual rollout of the new system, so that any issues can be identified and resolved without affecting all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Production_Environment SHALL support feature flags for gradual rollout control
2. WHERE feature flags are enabled, THE Production_Environment SHALL route requests through Hybrid_Orchestrator
3. WHERE feature flags are disabled, THE Production_Environment SHALL use legacy processing
4. THE Production_Environment SHALL allow per-user or percentage-based rollout configuration
5. THE Production_Environment SHALL provide rollback capability within 5 minutes of deployment
