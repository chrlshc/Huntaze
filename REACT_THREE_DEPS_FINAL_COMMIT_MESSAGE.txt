### Task 8: Monitoring & Rollback System
- Real-time monitoring: `lib/monitoring/threeJsMonitor.ts`
- React integration: `hooks/useThreeJsMonitoring.ts`
- API endpoints: `app/api/monitoring/three-js-errors/route.ts`
- Admin dashboard: `components/monitoring/ThreeJsHealthDashboard.tsx`
- Emergency rollback: `scripts/rollback-three-deps.js`
- Health validation: `scripts/validate-three-health.js`
